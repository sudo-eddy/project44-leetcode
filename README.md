# Project44 - 20 easy coding problems from leetcode

## How this project is structured:

* The files are written in markdown for better readability.
* All of the problems have their corresponding set of instructions
* Some of them have two versions of the code, one with `System.out.print` thrown between lines for more clarity and the other one is just clean code.
    - These are the problems that took me the longest to solve
* All of the problems have my thought process included (taking suggestions)

## Things I learned

I enjoyed doing this coding challenge, I learned to become a better programmer and look for the most efficient and readable approach.

Here are some bullet points I became familiar with and would like to use and explore more in detail. 

* Dynamic programming
    * Avoiding plain recursion
* Collections API
    * which [data structure to use](http://java-latte.blogspot.com/2013/06/dont-know-which-mapcollection-to-use.html) and when.
* top down approach
* bottom down approach
* bit manipulation and shifting
